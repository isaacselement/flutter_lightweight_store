## Simple to use

To run the example project, clone the repo, and run `pod install` from the Example directory first.

Just use the `TlStoreProxy` class as the API.

If you want to change the implementation for store, i.e you want to use Files to save Key-Value data instead of `NSUserDefaults`, just change the property `myProxy` of your `TlStoreProxy` instance.

## Installation

Xlightweight-Store-iOS is available through [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org). To install
it, simply add the following line to your Podfile:

```ruby
